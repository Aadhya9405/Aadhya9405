👧 About Me
I enjoy building creative and functional web applications that solve real-world problems. As a Computer Science undergraduate (2026), I’m focused on strengthening my foundations while applying what I learn through hands-on projects.
I’m currently improving my Data Structures & Algorithms (C++) skills and exploring full-stack web development, with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python basics. I love collaborating on projects, learning from others, and sharing ideas within the tech community.
✨ Fun fact: I love drawing and painting, and I’m obsessed with making aesthetic, well-organized notes. Music is always on while I work—it helps me think better and stay inspired.
